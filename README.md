# inpatient-charge-data-2016

Analysis of how Medicare benefitiaries are charged for hospital services and procedures when admitted into a hospital for the year 2016. 

Data comes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Can be found via the following link: 
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient2016.html


My thoughts as I am analyzing the data are found in the medicare_proj.pdf file. Not familiar with how Medicare/Medicaid pays for hospital services or typical hospital charging structures so I am going through everything that crosses my mind to get a better idea of what goes on and possible reasons why. 

A smaller file will be uploaded when I am finished going through everything that comes to mind summarizing the most important things I found and things I found noteworthy. 


Finally, also uploading my rmarkdown script which prints out the pdf in the medicare_proj.rmd file. It contains all the R code outputting the analysis, visualizations, etc.


I plan on combining it with another file containing state location, ie South, West, etc and state political affiliation in case there is a patter. Also plan on eventually including past dataset dating back to 2011 to see the progression of charges and payments and how they were affected by the adoption of lack of adoption of ACA era policies such as Medicare expansion.
